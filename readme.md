RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application.

1. Input Layer:

   - Documents: Source materials (PDFs, text files, web pages, etc.)
   - User Query: Natural language questions from users

2. Preprocessing Pipeline:

   - Chunking Pipeline: Splits documents into manageable segments while preserving context
   - Embedding Pipeline: Converts text chunks and queries into vector representations

3. Storage Layer:

   - Vector Store: Database optimized for vector similarity search (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)
   - Document Cache: Original document storage for context retrieval

4. Retrieval Layer:

   - Semantic Retrieval: Performs vector similarity search to find relevant chunks
   - Re-ranking: Refines results using more sophisticated but computationally intensive methods

5. Generation Layer:
   - Prompt Construction: Builds prompts combining query and retrieved context
   - Language Model: Generates responses (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
   - Post-processing: Filters and formats the final response

Key Implementation Considerations:

1. Chunking Strategy:

   - Use semantic chunking rather than fixed-size splits
   - Maintain document metadata and relationships
   - Consider overlap between chunks

2. Embedding Choices:

   - Select appropriate embedding models (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2, OpenAI ada-002)
   - Implement caching for frequently embedded text
   - Consider dimensionality reduction techniques

3. Retrieval Optimization:

   - Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
   - Use techniques like Maximum Marginal Relevance
   - Consider multi-stage retrieval pipelines

4. Quality Control:
   - Implement relevance scoring
   - Add source attribution
   - Include confidence metrics
